After an inexplicable incident occured, Happi and their three friends suddenly vanished like magic from TV screens. and now Happi has to rescue, restore and roam to get back home before they are forgotten for good!

Dart, dash and dawdle across the Land of the Lost, where you help people to smile...before he comes...

Don't you wanna help a childhood TV friend?
